# warmingstripes-3d

R code to generate the frames of a 3D animation of Ed Hawkins' [warmingstripes](https://showyourstripes.info/) using the [rayshader](https://github.com/tylermorganwall/rayshader) package.

Release `single-stripe` makes an animation of a single strip of warming stripes, while release `double-stripes-incl-co2` shows a comparison between two strips of stripes with an animated line plot with CO2 concentration below. Default single-stripe code uses homogenized monthly temperature time series of De Bilt obtained from the *Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI)*. Default double stripe code compares global temperature data with that of Kathmandu, Nepal.
